# TaxiServicesSQL ![Alt text](example.png?raw=true "Title")
An academic project where I used folium, PostgreSQL and PostGIS to create a heatmap of Porto's taxi services (taxi_services and taxi_stands databases) with Portugal's district's borders (CAOP database) or with a grid based display. Databases are missing due to GitHub's file size restriction.
